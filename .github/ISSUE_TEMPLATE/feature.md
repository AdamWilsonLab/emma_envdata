## Prework

* [ ] I understand and agree to this repository's [code of conduct](https://github.com/wlandau/targets-minimal/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* [ ] I understand and agree to this repository's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/wlandau/targets-minimal/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* [ ] New features take time and effort to create, and they take even more effort to maintain. So if the purpose of the feature is to resolve a struggle you are encountering personally, please consider first posting a "trouble" or "other" issue so we can discuss your use case and search for existing solutions first.

## Proposal

Please describe the potential feature.

To help us read any code you include (optional) please try to follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). The `style_text()` and `style_file()` functions from the [`styler`](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) package make it easier.
